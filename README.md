These last years, Twitter has become a good source for detecting disasters. People have been using this channel to coomunicate with the emergency team about accidents in real-time. Because of this, the interest of building a programm to monitor disaster tweets has grown quite fast recently. However, there are plenty of fake tweets that announs disaster that are not taking place. The goal is to find a ML model to differenciate those tweets with the true ones, so it can lead to a better performance of the emergency team.  

The dataset used in this project is the one found in the kaggle platform. The link is the following: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview/description
